# PHSX815_Week13

This is another week of using collegeadmissions.py.

The program will take the data points from the lat/long of US universities (excluding hawaii and alaska) and find two average values on the east and west coast.

I toyed around with adding some sort of weight system to get the values go where there are more universities (like the coasts), but decided against it for today.

Enjoy!
